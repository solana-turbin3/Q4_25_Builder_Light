Q: Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side
development?

A: Type Safety. Rust which is the language most solana programs are written on is a very type safe language,
so its quite expected for the language used to interace with them on the client side to be one which strongly
emphasizes type safety and has massive adoption. Hence, Typescript which ticks almost all boxes is a very optimal
choice for use by most client side developers.
